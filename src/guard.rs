//! A guard that enumerates what to check fails open on everything added after

//! an exemption has to be written down. `claude_desktop`'s note-sanitization
//! guard is built on this.
//!
//! Written by Augusto Claro for the encrypted-sync bundle format (#123) and
//! kept when that module was reverted, because the walking-guard idea outlived
//! the feature it was written for. The `production_code` comment below records
//! a real defect it was hardened against; the file names in it refer to that
