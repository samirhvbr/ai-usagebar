# Claude account guide

ai-usagebar can report several Claude accounts at once. On macOS, it can also
switch the active login used by Claude Desktop and the `claude` CLI.

## Choose a setup

| Need | Recommended setup |
|---|---|
| One Claude account | Use the default Claude Code login. No extra config is needed. |
| A few named accounts | Run `ai-usagebar account add <label>`. |
| Accounts already organized by `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Set `[anthropic] accounts_dir`. |
| Separate Waybar modules backed by files you already manage | Use `--creds-path` and `--cache-dir`. |
| Switch Claude Desktop or the CLI on macOS | Use `ai-usagebar account switch`. |
| Several Claude Desktop apps side by side on macOS | Use `ai-usagebar account merge-history`. |

## Add a named account

```bash
ai-usagebar account add work
```

The command:

- adds a `[[anthropic.accounts]]` entry without disturbing comments or
  formatting;
- creates a credentials directory for the account;
- runs `claude` with that account's own `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`.

The login goes straight to the source ai-usagebar reads: a scoped Keychain item
on macOS or `.credentials.json` on Linux and Windows. The default Claude login
is left alone. Re-run the command to sign in again, or pass `--no-login` to
register the account without opening Claude.

Once signed in, the account appears in the TUI and native integrations without
a restart, provided `[anthropic]` is enabled.

### Configure accounts by hand

```toml
[anthropic]
# Optional default account. Without this, ai-usagebar uses the platform default.
# credentials_path = "~/.claude/.credentials.json"

[[anthropic.accounts]]
label = "work"
credentials_path = "~/.config/ai-usagebar/accounts/work/.credentials.json"

[[anthropic.accounts]]
label = "personal"
credentials_path = "~/.config/ai-usagebar/accounts/personal/.credentials.json"
```

Select one with `--account`:

```bash
ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --account work
```

Or use it in Waybar:

```jsonc
"custom/claude-work": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --account work --format 'w {session_pct}% · {session_reset}'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true
}
```

Each named account gets its own cache under
`~/.cache/ai-usagebar/anthropic/<label>/`. The default account keeps the
original `~/.cache/ai-usagebar/anthropic/` path.

For Claude, `--account` cannot be combined with `--creds-path`. (OpenRouter
also supports `--account` through its own account array.) An unknown label
fails with a list of valid labels. The TUI shows the default Claude tab
followed by one tab for each named account.

If a CLI account and a saved Desktop profile share a label, aggregate views
such as the TUI and `usage --json` use the Desktop profile to avoid refreshing
the same rotating token from two stores. Direct widget commands are explicit:
add `--desktop` alongside `--account` when you want the Desktop profile.

## Discover accounts from a directory

Point `accounts_dir` at a directory whose immediate children are Claude Code
config directories:

```toml
[anthropic]
accounts_dir = "~/.config/ai-usagebar/accounts"
```

Populate each account with the official CLI:

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/ai-usagebar/accounts/personal claude
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.config/ai-usagebar/accounts/work claude
```

This is Claude Code's standard
[`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/settings)
layout. Each subdirectory becomes an account named after the directory.

- Linux stores `.credentials.json` inside the account directory.
- macOS stores a config-dir-scoped Keychain item.
- ai-usagebar reads and refreshes each source independently.
- Explicit `[[anthropic.accounts]]` entries override discovered accounts with
  the same label.
- A missing or unreadable `accounts_dir` is ignored.

Any account manager that uses the same directory layout can share these logins
with ai-usagebar.

## Use existing credential files in Waybar

This lower-level setup is for credential files you already manage. Prefer
`account add` for new logins so you never copy an active refresh token.

```jsonc
"modules-right": ["custom/claude-personal", "custom/claude-work", ...],

"custom/claude-personal": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --icon '󰚩' --format 'p {session_pct}% · {session_reset}'",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true
},
"custom/claude-work": {
    "exec": "ai-usagebar --vendor anthropic --icon '󰚩' --format 'w {session_pct}% · {session_reset}' --creds-path ~/.config/ai-usagebar/accounts/work.credentials.json --cache-dir ~/.cache/ai-usagebar/anthropic-work",
    "return-type": "json",
    "interval": 300,
    "tooltip": true
}
```

Keep these rules in mind:

- `--creds-path` must point to an independently managed Claude OAuth file.
  Refreshes are written back to that file.
- Never run two clients against copies of the same refresh token. Token
  rotation will eventually strand one copy.
- Keep credential files at mode `600`.
- Give each module a separate `--cache-dir`.
- `--creds-path` is Claude-only. For API-key providers, use a wrapper that
  exports the account's key and give each module its own cache directory.

On macOS, prefer `accounts_dir`; scoped Keychain items avoid copied credential
files entirely.

## Switch the active account on macOS

Usage reporting and the active login are separate. macOS has two independent
Claude identities:

- Claude Desktop, signed in through its own `config.json`;
- the `claude` CLI, whose default login lives in the login Keychain.

Use the same label for both if they belong to the same account:

```bash
ai-usagebar account add work
ai-usagebar account add work --desktop
ai-usagebar account status
ai-usagebar account status --json
ai-usagebar account switch work --dry-run
ai-usagebar account switch work --desktop
ai-usagebar account switch work --cli
```

Without `--desktop` or `--cli`, `switch` handles both identities. If a label
exists on only one side, the missing side is skipped.

### Capture a Desktop account

The CLI supports isolated logins through `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Claude Desktop
has only one login slot, so `account add <label> --desktop` must:

1. save the current Desktop login as a profile;
2. sign out and wait for the new login;
3. capture what Desktop writes;
4. seed the new profile with this machine's existing history.

Ctrl-C or a five-minute timeout restores the original login. CLI and Desktop
use different OAuth clients, so each identity must be captured separately.

### Switch Claude Desktop

Before switching, ai-usagebar merges local history into the target profile.
Session indexes use the newest copy; routines and schedules are merged by id.
It then quits Desktop, swaps the credential and browser state, and reopens the
app.

Every switch creates a rollback archive in `~/.claude-acc/backups/`:

- `--keep-backups N` controls retention (default: 10).
- `--backup-sessions` includes the full session tree.
- On Unix, the directory is mode `0700` and archives are mode `0600` because
  they contain credentials and browser state.

The switch clears `bridge-state.json` because stale cloud-session ids can stop
`/remote-control` from disconnecting. Pass `--keep-bridge` only when testing
that behavior.

### Switch the CLI

The CLI has one default credential slot. A switch first saves the outgoing
credential under its account, then moves the target credential into the
default slot. ai-usagebar reads an active account from that default slot while
its own file is gone — which is exactly what the switch leaves behind — so a
rotating refresh token is never live in two places.

A `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` layout is the other case. There every directory keeps its
own live login, and two of them can hold the *same* account, which is what the
active-account marker records. An account whose own credential file is still
there is therefore read from that file, not from the default slot: otherwise a
perfectly good account reports a re-auth prompt from a slot its owner never
signs into.

If the current CLI login is not managed by ai-usagebar, the switch stops before
discarding it. `--force` overrides that safeguard and removes the unmanaged
login.

### Adopt the login you already use

The account you signed into first usually lives only in the default slot. Rather
than signing it in again (which mints a second, independent grant for the same
account), register it as it is:

```bash
ai-usagebar account add main --adopt-current
```

This writes only the identity marker in the new account's directory. The
credential stays in the default slot, and the first switch away from `main`
saves it into `main`'s own slot like any other outgoing login. With every
account named, `[anthropic] show_default_account = false` drops the extra
unnamed tab.

### Switch Codex

Codex works the same way. The Codex CLI, the Codex desktop app and the IDE
extension all read `~/.codex/auth.json`, so one switch moves all three:

```bash
ai-usagebar account add main --codex --adopt-current  # the login ~/.codex already has
ai-usagebar account add work --codex                  # CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login
ai-usagebar account switch work --codex
```

The switch saves the outgoing login back into its account's `auth.json`, moves
the target's file into `~/.codex/auth.json`, and records each account's ChatGPT
account id in a marker next to its file (`.auth.json.ai-usagebar-account.json`,
no token), so an account whose file was moved away is still recognized. Reads
for the active account follow it into `~/.codex/auth.json`.

Before writing anything it checks the layout, and refuses when two accounts
share a credential file, an account points at `~/.codex/auth.json` itself, a
credential path is a symlink, two accounts are the same ChatGPT account, the
active account also kept its own copy, or `[openai] codex_auth_path` points
somewhere the Codex CLI does not read. The directories involved stay locked for
the whole move, and ai-usagebar's own token refresh takes the same lock, so the
two never interleave. If a step fails, every file it can put back is restored,
and any it could not is named in the error.

Codex itself is outside that lock. An open session keeps its account in memory
until it restarts; before refreshing it reloads `auth.json` and skips the
refresh when the account changed, but a refresh already in flight at the moment
of the switch could still write the old account's tokens back. Restart open
Codex sessions after switching.

### Switch from the macOS menu bar

With named accounts configured, each account's card in the `ai-usagebar-tray`
popover shows a switch control beside Customize and Reset. The active login has
a filled star; any other account has an outline star that runs the same
`ai-usagebar account switch` (with `--codex` for a Codex card). A Claude switch
quits and reopens Claude Desktop when that account also has a Desktop profile.
The star spins while the switch runs, and a failed switch turns it red with
the reason in its tooltip.

### Side-by-side profiles

Claude Desktop can be launched against an alternative profile with
`--user-data-dir`, which is how several accounts can run at once as separate
apps. Each such profile has its own history, so by default those windows do not
see each other's conversations.

```bash
ai-usagebar account merge-history --data-dir <DIR>
ai-usagebar account merge-history --data-dir <DIR> --dry-run
ai-usagebar account merge-history --data-dir <DIR> --from <DIR> --from <DIR>
```

`--from` names the profiles to read history from, defaulting to every other
profile on the machine: the default one, plus any sibling directory of
`--data-dir`. Sources are opened read-only and need not be idle. Run it just
before the app starts.

`account switch` is not usable here: it requires a saved profile per label and
installs that label's stored token over the profile's live login, and it quits
and relaunches Claude Desktop by *application name*, which is ambiguous once
several app bundles answer to the same name. `merge-history` swaps no
credential and never controls the app.

The merge is additive. No deletion sweep runs, so a run with nobody at the
keyboard cannot remove anything — conflicting items are reported and kept. The
target profile must not be running, detected from the process's own
`--user-data-dir` argument rather than the app name, and the default profile is
refused as a target (`account switch` owns it). Re-running is a no-op: an index
is copied only when the destination is absent or older.

Each relocated profile keeps its own sync ledger, in a
`<profile>-ai-usagebar/` directory beside it. That is deliberate rather than
incidental: the ledger records what each account held after the last merge, and
deletion candidates are the difference against it, so two profiles sharing one
ledger would each overwrite it with their own narrower view and items merely
absent from one profile would later read as intentional deletions.

**This deliberately crosses accounts.** Afterwards the window signed into one
account lists conversations and routines started under the others, because the
point is that every profile opens on the union. Do not use it across accounts
that must stay visually separate.

### Storage and history conflicts

CLI accounts use `[[anthropic.accounts]]` or `accounts_dir`. Desktop profiles
use claude-acc's format under `~/.claude-acc/profiles`; override that path with
`[anthropic] desktop_profiles_dir`. Existing claude-acc profiles work as-is.

History merges can expose deletions that another account has not seen yet.
When that happens, ai-usagebar asks whether to keep every copy, delete the item
from all accounts, or decide one item at a time. Deleting a chat removes only
its index; transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/` are never touched.

Non-interactive switches always keep conflicting items. The macOS menu bar
shows the same choices in a dialog. For scripts, `account status --json` lists
pending `deletion_conflicts`; pass the returned opaque key through
`--delete-conflict <key>`. Keys are scoped by item type, so a routine id cannot
authorize deletion of a chat with the same id.

Chats reconcile by `lastActivityAt`. Routines use a per-task three-way
baseline. Concurrent edits to the same routine keep both local copies and are
reported as a conflict. Edit the preferred copy again to resolve it on the next
switch.

Account removal and chat filters (`only` / `reset`) are not implemented. Remove
a profile directory manually or use claude-acc. Cowork sessions stay with the
account that created them because their transcript path contains the account
UUID.

The Desktop profile format and switching behavior are based on
[claude-acc](https://github.com/ohmaseclaro/claude-acc) (MIT). The Desktop
versions of `add` and `switch` share its profile store.
