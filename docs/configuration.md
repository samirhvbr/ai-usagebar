# Configuration reference

The config file is `~/.config/ai-usagebar/config.toml`. All fields are optional.
Claude, Codex, Z.AI, and OpenRouter are enabled by default; other providers are
opt-in. The commented example shows the defaults and provider-specific
settings.

Both binaries accept `--config <PATH>` to use an alternate file instead of the
default location (`%APPDATA%\ai-usagebar\config\config.toml` on Windows). The file
must already exist; loads and the Settings overlay then read and write that
file for the whole process, so a test config never touches the real one:

```bash
ai-usagebar --vendor kimi --config ./config.test.toml --watch 5
ai-usagebar-tui --config ./config.test.toml
```

```toml

# is selected when the TUI opens. Defaults to anthropic when not set.

# credentials_path = "/home/you/.local/share/devin/credentials.toml"
```

Devin remains opt-in when its CLI login is present. First-run detection and
`detect --all` do not enable it; set `enabled = true` explicitly to activate
the provider.

Devin reports daily and weekly remaining percentages, which ai-usagebar
converts to consumed percentages for consistent meters. A window whose reset
time arrives without a remaining percentage (the encoding omits zero values) is
shown as fully used. Its optional
`overageBalanceMicros` value is displayed as USD to six decimal places based on
the tested account; that currency interpretation is not a verified universal
contract. The existing CLI token is read only for the status request and cache
identity. ai-usagebar does not sign in, refresh, or rewrite Devin credentials.

For more than one OpenRouter key, see the
[OpenRouter account guide](openrouter-accounts.md). The existing singular
`[openrouter]` key remains the default account and needs no migration. Z.AI,
DeepSeek, DeepInfra, Kilo, Novita, Moonshot, Grok, MiniMax, OrcaRouter, and Lyceum take the same
`[[<vendor>.accounts]]` array and `show_default_account` switch — see the
[API-key account guide](api-key-accounts.md).

### Notifications

`[notifications]` controls the quota-threshold desktop alerts. They are on by
default at 97%: after a **fresh** fetch (never a cached or failed one), any
window at or above the threshold raises one notification — normal urgency
between the threshold and 99%, critical at 100% (exhausted). Linux delivers
via `notify-send` (`-a ai-usagebar -c quota`); macOS delivers through
Notification Center. The macOS popover also exposes the enable switch and
threshold in Preferences. Windows delivery is planned for a later release.

One crossing is one notification. A key re-arms only when usage drops 7
percentage points below the threshold (97 → below 90) or when the window's
reset moves to a later instant by more than an hour and a half — a smaller move
is the same window reported again, since vendors report the instant with
sub-second drift between fetches and a rolling window slides it forward with
the refresh interval — and the dedupe state lives in
`~/.cache/ai-usagebar/notifications.json` behind the same file locking as the
vendor caches. Banked reset credits (Codex, SuperGrok) also notify once, 48
hours before each credit expires. Bodies carry only vendor-reported absolute
resets — never a burn-rate estimate.

Delivery is best-effort: a missing or failing notifier, an unwritable state
file, or lock contention is a silent skip that never affects the bar, the
report, or any exit code. Both fields are also editable in the TUI Settings
overlay (`s`).

### Balance tanks

DeepSeek, DeepInfra, Kilo, Novita, Moonshot and prepaid Grok report how much money is
**left** and nothing else. There is no denominator in those responses, so
there is nothing to draw a meter against and the row is a plain balance.

`display_limit` supplies that denominator yourself — the size of the tank, in
the currency that vendor already reports:

```toml
[deepseek]
display_limit = 200        # you topped up $200 and want to watch it burn down
```

It must be finite and greater than zero; anything else fails at load with the
offending section named. There is no default and no built-in figure: leave it
out and nothing changes.

DeepInfra also shows the current calendar-month spend and the account's monthly
spending limit when the API supplies one. Its `display_limit` affects only the
prepaid-balance tank; it never replaces the provider's monthly limit.

It is a fallback, never an override: a vendor that states a limit of its own
keeps it. That is why **`[openrouter]` has no `display_limit` at all**. It
reports credits purchased against credits used (and a per-key limit when the key
has one), so there is nothing to fall back to — and in the one case where a tank
would not simply be ignored, a free-tier account that purchased nothing,
honouring it would be actively wrong: that row's percentage comes from the API,
not from the tank, so the bar would read `0%` for an account with money in it.
A free-tier OpenRouter account therefore keeps its dollar figure on the bar even
at the `"percent"` default. `[openrouter]` does take `headline`.

The Anthropic Admin API's `monthly_limit` is a separate, older setting and is
unaffected.

The percentage is **consumed**, matching every other meter in the app:

```
(display_limit - balance) / display_limit, clamped to 0–100
```

A balance above the cap reads as 0% used; the money figure is what says how far
above it sits.

`headline` is a separate choice: which of the two numbers goes on the bar.

| value       | bar        | detail line |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `"amount"`  | `$50.00`   | `75% of $200.00 used ($50.00 left)` |
| `"percent"` | `75%`      | `$50.00 of $200.00 left (75% used)` |

Balance vendors default to `"amount"`; `[openrouter]`, which always has a
denominator of its own, defaults to `"percent"`. Setting `display_limit` does
not switch the headline by itself, and choosing `"percent"` with no limit from
either source leaves the amount on the bar rather than inventing a percentage.

`[nous]` takes `headline` as well, and needs no `display_limit`: its plan's
monthly credits are already the percentage's denominator. `"amount"` puts the
credits still usable on the bar — the Portal's total usable credits, falling
back to top-up credits and then to subscription credits — and leaves the
consumed percentage in the meter, the severity colour and the detail line.

The Omarchy panel, the KDE plasmoid and the tray popover (Windows and macOS)
read the metric's own `headline` field out of `usage --json` rather than
guessing from the row's label. In the popover, `"amount"` puts the money figure
under the meter and moves the percentage and the detail line to its hover text;
`"percent"` keeps the popover's used/left toggle. Waybar and GNOME build their
bar text from the per-vendor formats, so `headline` does not reach them.

### GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot uses the OAuth login managed by the official GitHub CLI. Run
`gh auth login --web`, then select **GitHub Copilot** under **Primary Provider**
in the Omarchy settings form and save; this enables `[copilot]` and sets it as
the primary provider. The normal fetch path runs only the fixed structured
command `gh auth token`. ai-usagebar never parses GitHub CLI configuration or
credential stores and never writes the OAuth token to its config or cache.

`GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN` is an optional explicit environment override. It takes
precedence over `gh auth token`, which can be useful for a managed runtime that
provides its own short-lived token. Do not put that token in `config.toml`.

For more than one Codex login, add `[[openai.accounts]]` — a label and that
login's own `auth.json`, the same shape `[[anthropic.accounts]]` uses:

```toml
[[openai.accounts]]
label = "work"
codex_auth_path = "~/.config/ai-usagebar/accounts/work-codex/auth.json"
```

Create the second login with `CODEX_HOME=~/.codex-work codex login` and point
`codex_auth_path` at the file it writes. Select it with `--account work`; each
account caches separately under `~/.cache/ai-usagebar/openai/<label>`. The
singular `codex_auth_path` remains the default account and needs no migration.

For more than one GitHub Copilot plan — a personal and a work account, say —
add `[[copilot.accounts]]`. ai-usagebar stores no token of its own here: `gh`
already keeps several logins per host, so an entry only needs that login's
name, as printed by `gh auth status`:

```toml
[[copilot.accounts]]
label = "work"
user = "my-work-login"
```

Each account resolves through `gh auth token --user <user>`, so signing in
stays entirely `gh`'s job (`gh auth login`, once per account). Select one with
`--account work`; each caches separately under
`~/.cache/ai-usagebar/copilot/<label>`. With no `accounts` array the behavior
is unchanged: whichever account `gh` has active. `show_default_account = false`
hides that unnamed entry once every account is named, and is ignored while the
array is empty.

Two deliberate limits. `GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN` names no account, so combining it
with `--account` is an error rather than a silent choice between the two — the
alternative is reporting one account's quota under another's label. And there
is no `hostname` field: `gh` can hold a GitHub Enterprise login, but the quota
endpoint (`api.github.com/copilot_internal/user`) is github.com-only, so the
field would promise support the fetch cannot deliver.

`ai-usagebar account add <label> --codex` writes that entry and runs the login
for you; `ai-usagebar account switch <label> --codex` makes a named login the
one the Codex CLI, desktop app and IDE extension use. See "Switch Codex" in
[claude-accounts.md](claude-accounts.md). Once every login is named, set
`[openai] show_default_account = false` so the active account is not listed a
second time as the unnamed default.

### Explicitly enable a provider

Run `ai-usagebar settings enable anthropic` to set `[anthropic].enabled = true`,
including when it was explicitly false. This is an explicit opt-in; automatic
detection continues to respect disabled providers. The command preserves other
settings, comments, and credentials, and supports `--config PATH` to edit an
existing alternate configuration. It does not sign in or select a primary
provider. Successful writes return `{"ok":true}`; failures exit nonzero.
