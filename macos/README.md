# AI Usage Bar — macOS menu bar app

A native macOS menu bar app for [`ai-usagebar`](../README.md). It shows the
**5-hour (session)** and **weekly** usage bars — plus an optional
dynamic **model-scoped** bar (for example, Fable) and **extra-usage (cost)**
bar — in the menu bar next to the clock, with a native dropdown. It's the macOS counterpart to the [GNOME Shell
extension](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-usagebar/tree/main/gnome-extension): same binary, same One Dark colors and
severity thresholds.

A single Swift file (`NSStatusItem` + `NSAttributedString`); no Xcode project.

> **Installing?** Follow the step-by-step in **[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**.

## v0.13 vendor scope

The selector supports **Anthropic, OpenAI, Z.AI, OpenRouter, and DeepSeek**.
**Kimi is widget/TUI-only in this release**; desktop protocol and marker parity
for Kimi is dedicated future work. DeepSeek is balance-only, so the app shows
its balance in the header and suppresses the 5h/weekly quota rows.

## Requirements

- macOS with the **Command Line Tools** (`xcode-select --install`) for `swiftc`.
- The `ai-usagebar` binary on the Mac. Install it with `cargo install ai-usagebar`
  (lands in `~/.cargo/bin`) — see the [main README](../README.md).
- Run `claude` once on the Mac so its OAuth creds are in the login **Keychain**;
  ai-usagebar reads them there automatically (no env vars).

## Build & run

```bash
cd macos
./build.sh                 # swiftc -O → ./ai-usagebar-menubar
./ai-usagebar-menubar &    # appears in the menu bar (no Dock icon)
```

Start at login:

```bash
./install-agent.sh         # installs a LaunchAgent (RunAtLoad)
```

> Not code-signed. It's a local binary you built yourself, so Gatekeeper
> doesn't block it when launched from the terminal / LaunchAgent. If macOS ever
> complains, right-click the binary in Finder → **Open** once.

## Configuration

Open **Preferences** from the dropdown (or press **⌘,**) — a native window
with toggles, color pickers, vendor, interval, bar width, and binary path.
Settings persist in `UserDefaults` and apply **live, no rebuild**.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Show 5h / weekly / extra | on / on / off | which bars appear |
| Show percentage/value | on | numeric value next to each bar |
| Show bars | on | off = numbers only |
| Show pace marker | on | persisted `showMeta`; draws the elapsed-time marker only when the window has reset and elapsed output |
| Bar width | 8 | cells per menu-bar bar (4–20) |
| Colors (low/mid/high/critical/empty) | One Dark | bar color per severity (≥90 / ≥75 / ≥50 / else) |
| Refresh interval | 30 s | 5–3600 |
| Vendor | anthropic | selectors: Anthropic, OpenAI, Z.AI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek (not Kimi). Anthropic, OpenAI, and Z.AI expose generic session/weekly windows; pace markers require Anthropic elapsed placeholders. |
| Binary path | auto | empty = `~/.cargo/bin`, Homebrew, then `PATH` |

The Preferences window needs **macOS 12+** (the menu bar itself works on
10.15+). Tags/labels use the system label colors, so they adapt to a light or
dark menu bar; only the bar fill/empty colors are configurable.

Pace markers require both a real reset and elapsed-time output. Currently only
Anthropic's elapsed placeholder family supplies that pair, so other vendors can
render their generic windows without a pace marker. When available, the fixed
blue `│` pace marker is placed at elapsed time. Fill past the marker follows the
point-delta colors used by the Rust widget: at
least 10 points ahead is critical/red, 1–9 ahead is high/orange, -10 through
on-pace is mid/yellow, and more than 10 under is low/green. Windows without a
reset (including a displayed `—`) retain their row but do not draw a marker.

## How it works

Runs `ai-usagebar --vendor <v> --format '{plan};;{session_pct};;…'`, parses the
Waybar JSON (`{text, …}`), and draws the bars as colored `NSAttributedString`s
in the status item and the dropdown. The subprocess runs **off the main thread**
(`DispatchQueue.global` → back to `.main` for UI), so the UI never blocks.
