# AI Usage Bar — macOS menu bar app

The product UI is **`ai-usagebar-tray`**: an NSStatusItem plus a WKWebView
popover. **Settings → Appearance → Popover Style** picks its look: **Classic**
(every provider's card at a glance, the default) or **Native** (the system's
own look — on macOS, one provider at a time behind tabs of logos and values,
over AppKit glass). Both draw the same provider card: metrics, reset times,
pace notes, the reset popover, the row menu and account switching.

Install **AI Usage.app** in `/Applications` from the macOS release archive; see
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for release and source-build instructions. Its stable
bundle identity lets menu-bar managers recognize the app, including Hidden Bar
on macOS 27. The packaging step uses no developer certificate or notarization
credentials; the standalone executables remain available for CLI use.
Hidden Bar on macOS 27 can also hide bundles in `~/Applications`, so use the
system Applications folder; see the install guide's troubleshooting notes.
The Finder icon reuses `windows/tray-icon.svg`; regenerate its `.icns` sizes
with `swift macos/render-icon.swift` after changing that artwork.

**Settings → Menu Bar → Menu Bar Shows** draws the usage **Chart** (the default)
from up to two starred metrics per provider, or **Logos**, each starred
provider's logo followed by one readable percentage. Logos takes the highest
usage across that provider's visible quota windows, like Quattro's default
`auto` window and the Quattro chip. In **Left** this is the lowest remaining
percentage: 25% monthly remaining stays `25%` even after the weekly allowance
resets to 100%. A more-used short/session or model-specific window can win too;
switch it off in Customize to exclude it. Balances remain amounts. All the
individual readings remain in the popover.
**Quattro** draws one chip like the Quattro
bar: the logo, the short name (`cld`, `cdx`, …) and the highest percentage
of the provider selected in the popover (the Native style's tabs; the
`[ui] primary` provider, then the first one with a value, until you pick one).
Like Quattro's default window, it takes the highest of all the provider's
windows, starred or not, the same value its tab shows: a spent weekly limit
reads `100%` even while the 5h session reads `0%`. A metric hidden in
Customize does not count. **Show Short Name** turns the name off,
leaving the logo and the value; a provider with no logo keeps its name. The
Logos and Quattro values follow **Preferences → Show Usage As**, like the popover's
tabs and meters: what is left, by default, or what is used. With
nothing starred it shows the app icon. Left-click opens the popover; right-click opens the Options menu.

```bash
cargo build --release --bin ai-usagebar-tray
./target/release/ai-usagebar-tray
```

Needs Node.js 20+ on PATH for the first build (`windows/popover/` Vite bundle).
Left-click the status item to toggle the popover. Right-click it for the
footer's Options menu as a native menu, in the popover's language: Customize
(Classic only), Settings, Refresh, Detect Providers, Open TUI, Start at Login,
Check for Updates, About, and Quit; the items that name a screen open the
popover on it. No Dock icon.

The popover also toggles from anywhere with a configurable global shortcut,
**Settings → General → Global Shortcut** (stored as `[tray] shortcut` in
`config.toml`). On macOS the Command and Option keys are shown as `Cmd` and
`Option`; the stored value keeps the canonical `Win`/`Alt` spelling.

Star up to two metrics per provider from **Settings → Providers**, then open
that provider's details, or right-click a row. Those metrics drive Chart;
in Logos, the stars select the providers and each gets one allowance summary.

With named Claude or Codex accounts, each account's card also shows which login
is active (a filled star) and an outline star to switch to the others; see "Switch from
the macOS menu bar" in [docs/claude-accounts.md](../docs/claude-accounts.md).

The footer's Options menu opens Settings. Settings uses five tabs: **General**
(startup, refresh, shortcut), **Providers** (visibility, order, metric details),
**Menu** (the menu-bar summary), **Preferences** (language, appearance, usage
display), and **Alerts** (system notifications and the quota threshold). Start
at Login writes a LaunchAgent under `~/Library/LaunchAgents`. Alerts are sent
through macOS Notification Center after a fresh reading crosses the threshold.
In **Preferences → Usage Display**, enable **Usage goal** to show a second,
subtle bar below each metric. It marks how much of the quota would be used now
at an even pace from the start of its reset window to 100% at the end, or, while
the bars show what is left, how much should still remain. Five-hour,
weekly, and other windows use the provider's reported duration. Monthly windows
without an exact duration use the previous calendar month and are labeled as
estimates. The current usage and goal percentages sit at the right edge of their
respective bars. The reset note below them can include the projected usage at
the end of the window; **Always Show Pacing** makes that projection visible
even for metrics comfortably below the limit. Metrics without a reset time or
usable window do not show a goal.

A legacy Swift `NSMenu` (`ai-usagebar-menubar.swift`) remains in this folder
for the old dropdown. Prefer the tray.

## Vendor scope

The selector dynamically discovers **all providers** that ship in the binary via `ai-usagebar vendors --json`:

- **Rate-limit windows (session / weekly / monthly):** Claude, Codex,
  Z.AI (GLM), Google Antigravity (two independent pools — Gemini, and
  Claude & GPT OSS — each with its own 5h/weekly pair), MiniMax (chat and video
  pools, each with 5h/weekly tracking), GitHub Copilot (premium finite pool,
  with unlimited chat and completions reported cleanly), SuperGrok, Kiro,
  Nous Research, OpenCode Go (session, weekly, and monthly pools), Command Code
  (session, weekly, and monthly pools), Grok Bot (weekly included-usage
  pool from the Grok Bot desktop app), and Devin (daily and weekly quotas
  from the Devin CLI).
- **Included-usage pools:** Cursor (Cursor Models and Other Models, both reset
  on the billing cycle).
- **Balance-only:** OpenRouter, DeepSeek, DeepInfra, Kimi, Kilo, Novita,
  Moonshot, Grok (xAI), Lyceum, and Anthropic API. These have no 5h/weekly
  quota windows, so the app
  shows their balance/credits in the header (`cr <amount>`) and suppresses the
  session/weekly rows. Anthropic API additionally renders a spend-vs-limit
  bar when a monthly limit is configured.

The app uses `ai-usagebar vendors --json` as its canonical metadata source so
vendor availability, authentication status, and CLI requirements always match the
backend without duplicated static tables. Only **enabled** vendors appear in the selector. The opt-in vendors default
to disabled in the Rust config, matching `src/config.rs`; set
`[vendor].enabled = true` (or save an API key via the TUI) to turn one on.

Antigravity has no credential file to check, so the Vendors pane treats it as
**configured** once it finds any of Antigravity 2.0/IDE/`agy`'s state
directories (`~/.gemini/{antigravity,antigravity-cli,antigravity-ide}`) — the
binary itself discovers whichever local server is actually reachable
(Antigravity 2.0, the IDE, or an interactive `agy` session) via `lsof` at fetch
time, so one of those must be running for quota to load.

## Requirements

- Rust (`rustc` 1.90+) and **Node.js 20+** (the tray embeds the Vite popover).
- Run `claude` once on the Mac so its OAuth creds are in the login **Keychain**;
  ai-usagebar reads them there automatically (no env vars).

## Build & run

```bash
cargo build --release --bin ai-usagebar-tray
./target/release/ai-usagebar-tray
```

Start at login from the popover **Settings → Launch at Login**. That writes
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.akitaonrails.ai-usagebar-tray.plist`.

The legacy Swift dropdown:

```bash
cd macos
./build.sh
./ai-usagebar-menubar &
```

> Not code-signed. It's a local binary you built yourself, so Gatekeeper
> doesn't block it when launched from the terminal / LaunchAgent. If macOS ever
> complains, right-click the binary in Finder → **Open** once.

## Configuration

Open **Preferences** from the dropdown (or press **⌘,**) — a native window
with toggles, color pickers, vendor, interval, bar width, and binary path.
Settings persist in `UserDefaults` and apply **live, no rebuild**.

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Show 5h / weekly / extra | on / on / off | which bars appear |
| Show percentage/value | on | numeric value next to each bar |
| Show bars | on | off = numbers only |
| Show pace marker | on | persisted `showMeta`; draws the elapsed-time marker only when the window has reset and elapsed output |
| Show reset time instead of a countdown | off | persisted `showResetClock`; shows *when* a window resets as a wall-clock time — a date once the reset is past today — following the system's 12h/24h convention |
| Bar width | 8 | cells per menu-bar bar (4–20) |
| Colors (low/mid/high/critical/empty) | One Dark | bar color per severity (≥90 / ≥75 / ≥50 / else) |
| Refresh interval | 30 s | 5–3600 |
| Vendor | anthropic | selectors: only enabled vendors (see [Vendor scope](#vendor-scope)). Vendors expose rate-limit windows (session, weekly, monthly, or video pools); balance-only vendors show a credit balance instead. |
| Binary path | auto | empty = `~/.cargo/bin`, Homebrew, then `PATH` |
| Global vendor shortcut | on | **⌥⌘\\** cycles every configured vendor/account and Overview; turns itself back off if macOS cannot register it |
| Global compact shortcut | on | **⌥⌘E** toggles Overview between mini bars and compact text; turns itself back off if unavailable |
| Start at login | current LaunchAgent state | writes/removes the per-user LaunchAgent; write errors are shown below the toggle |

`[ui] overview_vendors = ["anthropic", "cursor", "openai"]` in
`config.toml` limits and orders the Overview on macOS exactly as it does in the
TUI. Requesting `anthropic` includes every configured named Claude account.

In Overview mode, each dropdown row is a **checkbox**: click it to drop that
provider from the always-visible top-bar summary (checkmark = shown; unchecked +
dimmed = hidden). Hidden providers stay listed so you can re-enable them, and the
choice persists. Jumping to a provider's detail view is via the *Switch provider*
submenu / ⌥⌘\ (the Overview row click toggles visibility instead).

The Preferences window needs **macOS 12+** (the menu bar itself works on
10.15+). Tags/labels use the system label colors, so they adapt to a light or
dark menu bar; only the bar fill/empty colors are configurable.

Pace markers require both a real reset and elapsed-time output. Claude, Codex,
Z.AI, MiniMax, Antigravity, Grok Bot and Cursor supply that pair; the remaining vendors render
their generic windows without a pace marker. Cursor's two pools share the
billing cycle, so both markers sit at the same elapsed position; a cycle whose
start the API did not report draws none. When available, the fixed
blue `│` pace marker is placed at elapsed time. Fill past the marker follows the
point-delta colors used by the Rust widget: at
least 10 points ahead is critical/red, 1–9 ahead is high/orange, -10 through
on-pace is mid/yellow, and more than 10 under is low/green. Windows without a
reset (including a displayed `—`) retain their row but do not draw a marker.

## Indicator style

The "Indicator style" preference chooses between **block bars** (`░█`, the
default) and a **ring** (`○`) drawn with `NSBezierPath` (AppKit). The ring paints
the usage fraction as a severity-colored arc over a faint track, with the same
pace marker as the block bar: calm fill from 12 o'clock up to the lesser of the
current percentage and the elapsed tick; any fill past the tick is
warning-colored. Both the menu
bar and the dropdown rows honor the choice. The track adapts to the effective
appearance — faint white on dark menu bars (where the dark `COLOR_EMPTY` would
be invisible) and `COLOR_EMPTY` on light ones.

## Quick vendor switch

A **"Switch provider"** submenu in the dropdown (between "Refresh now" /
"Open TUI" and "Preferences…") lists only configured vendors, with a
checkmark on the active one.
Selecting one switches immediately, without opening Preferences.
The global **⌥⌘\\** shortcut performs the same cycle from any app; disable it
under Preferences → Shortcut if that chord belongs to another application.

## Multiple Claude accounts

Named Anthropic accounts from the binary's config
(`[[anthropic.accounts]]` entries and `[anthropic] accounts_dir`
auto-discovery — see the main README's "Multiple accounts") each get their own
entry, "Claude · label", in the vendor submenu, the ⌥⌘\ swap ring, the
Preferences selector, and the Overview. Each is fetched as
`--vendor anthropic --account <label>`, so caches and token refreshes stay
per-account. Set `[anthropic] show_default_account = false` to hide the
default (unnamed) Claude entry when every account is managed explicitly.
Every immediate `accounts_dir` subdirectory counts as an account; this includes
macOS logins whose credentials exist only in a config-dir-scoped Keychain item.

### Switching which account you are signed in as

Those entries decide whose usage is *shown*. Which account you are actually
signed in as is a separate thing — and there are two of them, the Claude
Desktop app and the `claude` CLI, which drift apart.

Preferences has a **Claude accounts** section — **Claude Desktop** and
**Claude Code**, each listing the accounts it knows with the active one marked.
Press **Switch** on another to move to it; press **Add account…** to capture a
new one (that part is interactive, so it opens in Terminal). They live in
Preferences rather than the dropdown so that someone who uses only one of them,
or neither, does not carry two permanent menu rows. A dim line under the
dropdown header still shows both active accounts at a glance —
`Desktop: work · Code: personal`.

Switching the Desktop app **quits and reopens Claude.app**, so Preferences
confirms first; your local history is merged into the target account and a
rollback archive is written before anything changes. The Claude Code switch has
no visible side effect and happens straight away. The buttons grey out while a
switch is running.

The same thing from the shell:

```bash
ai-usagebar account status                  # who each surface is signed in as
ai-usagebar account add work --desktop      # capture a Claude Desktop account
ai-usagebar account switch work --dry-run   # what a switch would do
ai-usagebar account switch work --desktop   # quits and reopens Claude.app
```

See the main README's *Switching the active Claude account* for the full story.

## Multiple Codex accounts

Entries from `[[openai.accounts]]` appear as “Codex · label” in the provider
submenu, Preferences, Overview, and the vendor-cycle shortcut. Each is fetched
with `--vendor openai --account <label>`; Rust resolves its `codex_auth_path`
and keeps its cache separate. Named accounts do not require a default Codex
login. Disabling `[openai]` hides all its accounts.

Setting `[ui] overview_vendors = ["openai"]` includes all configured Codex
accounts. Each Overview checkbox still controls that account's visibility.
Selecting an entry changes whose usage is displayed, not the active Codex login.

## Multiple API-key accounts

Entries from `[[openrouter.accounts]]` — and the same array under `[zai]`,
`[deepseek]`, `[deepinfra]`, `[kilo]`, `[novita]`, `[moonshot]`, `[grok]`, `[minimax]`, and
`[orcarouter]` — appear as separate menu choices and use
`--vendor <vendor> --account <label>` behind the scenes. Each account keeps its
own cache. Set `show_default_account = false` in the provider's section when
you do not want the unnamed key listed. See the main
[API-key account guide](../docs/api-key-accounts.md) and the
[OpenRouter account guide](../docs/openrouter-accounts.md) for configuration.

## Live config reload

The app watches `config.toml` and reloads on any change — enable a vendor, add
an account, tweak an `[ui]` knob, and the menu bar updates within a second, no
restart. It re-arms across an editor's atomic save, and a half-written file
mid-edit is ignored (the running config is kept until the file parses again).
The TUI does the same, polling the file every couple of seconds.

## How it works

Runs `ai-usagebar --vendor <v> --format '{plan};;{session_pct};;…'`, parses the
Waybar JSON (`{text, …}`), and draws the bars as colored `NSAttributedString`s
in the status item and the dropdown. The subprocess runs **off the main thread**
(`DispatchQueue.global` → back to `.main` for UI), so the UI never blocks.

### Enable a connected provider

Preferences → Vendors shows **Disabled** even when a credential is available.
Click **Enable** to include the provider in usage reporting; if it still needs
a credential, the row then offers its usual sign-in or configuration action.
Enabling does not sign in, switch accounts, or change the selected provider.
The menu reloads the configuration automatically.

This requires a binary supporting `ai-usagebar settings enable <vendor>`.
If enabling fails, Preferences shows an error and keeps the provider state
from the catalog. Update the binary if it does not recognize the command.
